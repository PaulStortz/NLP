We had a huge effect on the Internet. And it had a huge effect on us.

During Microsoft's 21 year history, the pace of innovation has been quite rapid. This past year stands out both for the exciting new products and the broad recognition that computers will revolutionize communications. Windows 95 was launched, and 40 million people were introduced to its benefits: ease of use, 32 bit applications, and increased productivity. Windows NT established phenomenal sales momentum and gained widespread acceptance as the foundation for the enterprise market and a new generation of corporate intranets and Web servers.

The Internet came of age, and Microsoft embraced the opportunity by enhancing its entire range of products and services to create the best Web experience for everyone from the casual Web surfer to the corporate IT manager. Microsoft is betting that over the next decade Internet use will grow dramatically. Next year research and development spending, broadly defined, will grow to more than $2 billion, at a growth rate faster than sales. Our R&D is driven by customer feedback and our belief that there are many breakthroughs in software that we can achieve by taking a long term approach.

In our dialog with the financial community, we go out of our way to point out the challenges of maintaining or increasing our profitability. This conservatism is part of our culture. Despite this, we feel the prospects for our business over the next decade are very strong.

I want to thank our employees, customers, partners, and shareholders for all of their support in building Microsoft.
