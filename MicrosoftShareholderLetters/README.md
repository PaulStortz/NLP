# NLP Project - Shareholder Letters
This project uses 25 years of Microsoft shareholder letters then applies Python functions to them for document analysis. 

This Python program splits a text file into different words, then deletes, punctuation, deletes bullets, deletes stopwords, strips plural words,
and makes them sigular words, strips past tense words, makes adverbs regular verbs, then displays the top 50 words by count. This export can then be used in Tableau or charts can be made in Python to display these data.
